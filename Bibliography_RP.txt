Ruonan has been based in Edinburgh, where she obtained her PhD using statistical machine learning pipelines to harness large collections of electronic healthcare records from Scotland for risk prediction modelling. She is familiar with conducting analyses in secure environments and working on generating imputed data to promote reproducibility outside such restrictive environments. In a nutshell, she has been developing and assessing joint models to get under the bonnet of intra- and inter-individual variation at the risk of developing a condition and the rate of progression to later disease stages.
